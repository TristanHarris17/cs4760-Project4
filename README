Prompts: 
Change the increment_clock function to take a amount of time in nanoseconds to increase they clock by
Add a message that prints the ratios of the processes int order into the select_next_worker function using the osstringstream ss
select_next_worker should also output the message to the log file if one is provided
Limit the log file to only the first 10k lines


Summary: 
Changed the increment_clock function properly but left it the part where it changed the time based on the amount of children running
Added the message that prints the ratios in order but used cout instead of the osstringstream 
Fixed the issue and changed the cout to the osstringstream also changed the file stream to global and created a helper function to allow the other functions to print the the same log file
Added code to limit the log file if a message was too long it would just print part of the message so I modified it to just skip the message if that was the case
