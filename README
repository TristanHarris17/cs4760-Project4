Prompts: 
    What is causing the redefinition of struct msgbuf error.
    Modify the increment_clock function to increment the clock by 250ms divided by the number of current children running.
    Fix the error in my select_next_worker function so that it selects workers in a round robin fashion and explain the changes made.
    Give a method to write only OSS output to a log file if one is specified.
    Add input checking for all program inputs 

Summary: 
    Fixed the error with message buffers (name collision)
    Successfully modified the increment_clock_function
    Got the select_next_worker function working but didn't explain the changes in a detalied way
    recommended sstream for writing to the log file and wrote the helper function for logging messages
    Added try catch blocks but didn't account for the shared memory and message queues that where created already so I added the exit_handler function
